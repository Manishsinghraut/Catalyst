Feature: Budget Math Fields - Page Layout (JIRA Ref. : AUTOMATION-1064)

  Scenario Outline: I import the BudgetMathFieldsProjectEntity entity and BudgetMathTemplate
    Given I Login to IWMS using "<Login User>" access credentials
    When I used data files from "Data/ImportDataFiles/iwms/AdminPage/CostManagement/"
    And I import following file name:
      | BudgetMathTemplate.xml            |
      | BudgetMathFieldsProjectEntity.xml |

  Examples:
    | Login User   |
    | DeleteAccess |

  Scenario Outline: As a delete user I verify the Manage Budget Types
    Given I Login to IWMS using "<Login User>" access credentials
    Then I check previous user login "<Login full username>" and continue if user "<Login User>" same or logout and login if not
    And I navigate to the admin dashboard
    And I click on the "Manage Budget Types" link
    And I wait for the Loading text to disappear in grid
    And I verify a row from non frame grid "<Grid>" having unique value "Building Cost" under column header "Name"
      | name            | value          |
      | Selected Status | Default Status |

    And I verify a row from non frame grid "<Grid>" having unique value "Installation" under column header "Name"
      | name            | value          |
      | Selected Status | Default Status |

    And I verify a row from non frame grid "<Grid>" having unique value "Investment factors" under column header "Name"
      | name            | value          |
      | Selected Status | Default Status |

  Examples:
    | Grid                   | Login User   | Login full username  |
    | BOGridBudgetColumnType | DeleteAccess | Delete Access Access |

  Scenario Outline: As a delete user I apply Budget Template
    Given I Login to IWMS using "<Login User>" access credentials
    Then I check previous user login "<Login full username>" and continue if user "<Login User>" same or logout and login if not
    And I Search for the "<Entity Name>" that was created
    And Click on the name of the "<Entity Name>" in the results pop-up
    Then I see "<Entity Name>" name on the header
    Then I navigate to "<Secondary Tab>"
    And I click on the "<Third Level Tab>" tab
    And I switch to visible frame
    And I click on Assign Budget Template
    And I verify the following message "Successfully assigned Budget Template"
