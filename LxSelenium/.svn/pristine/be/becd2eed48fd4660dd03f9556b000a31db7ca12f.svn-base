    Given I Login to IWMS using "<Login User>" access credentials
    Then I check previous user login "<Login full username>" and continue if user "<Login User>" same or logout and login if not
    When I used data files from "/Data/ImportDataFiles/iwms/Contract/PaymentInfo/RecurringExpenses/GenerateRent/"
    And I import following file name:
      | PartialMonthRentContract.xml |

#    And I navigate to entity type "<Entity Type>" named "<Contract Name>"
    When I Search for the "<Contract Name>" that was created
    And Click on the name of the "<Contract Name>" in the results pop-up
