Feature: Recurring expense for various International currency types should generate transactions correctly (Jira Ref: AUTOMATION-1291)

  Scenario Outline: As a delete user I Navigate to  Admin Dashboard > Manage Company > Financial Settings > and select JPY as the 'Home Currency' and click 'Update'
    Given I Login to IWMS using "<Login User>" access credentials
    Then I check previous user login "<Login full username>" and continue if user "<Login User>" same or logout and login if not
    When I used data files from "Data/ImportDataFiles/iwms/Contract/Details/"
    And I import following file name:
      | 15686Contract_1291.xml |


  Examples:
    | Login User   | Login full username  |
    | DeleteAccess | Delete Access Access |


  Scenario Outline: As a delete user I Navigate to "15686Contract" and verify the currency type
    Given I Login to IWMS using "<Login User>" access credentials

    And I Search for the "<Entity Name>" that was created
    And Click on the name of the "<Entity Name>" in the results pop-up
    Then I see "<Entity Name>" name on the header
    And I click on the "<Third Level Tab>" tab
    And I switch to visible frame
    And I verify pair of values on non editable summary page
      | name     | value |
      | Currency | USD   |
    And I switch to default frame

  Examples:
    | Login User   | Login full username  | Entity Name   | Third Level Tab |
    | DeleteAccess | Delete Access Access | 15686Contract | Summary         |
